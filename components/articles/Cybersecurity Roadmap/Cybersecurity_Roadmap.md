## Cybersecurity Roadmap

### What is cybersecurity? 

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and the best way to protect your organization is to stay informed and up to date on the latest threats and best practices.

### Why is cybersecurity important?

Cybersecurity is important because it protects your organization from cyberattacks. Cyberattacks can be costly, and they can have a significant impact on your organization’s reputation. Cybersecurity is also important because it protects your organization’s data. Data is the lifeblood of your organization, and it’s important to protect it from cyberattacks.
